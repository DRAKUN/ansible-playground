# Ansible Starter Kit

This repository is aimed at starting fast and effective with ansible.

* Fill the `hosts` file with you groups and hosts.
* Modify the `ssh.cfg` config file to fit your needs.
* Write new playbooks in `playbooks` directory.
* Operate from the project root so that `ansible.cfg` and `ssh.cfg` are 
taken into account by all ansible commands.
* Run `ansible all -m ping`: if you get `pong` response from all hosts, you are
ready to operate.
